#Contacts App
An Android application built using Java and Android Studio that allows users to add, update, delete, and search contacts. 
This project demonstrates clean architecture, OOP concepts, and basic CRUD operations.

#Features
Add new contacts
Delete contacts
Search contacts by name/number
View all saved contacts
Simple and clean UI
Uses Java + Android Studio

#Tech Stack:
Java
Android Studio
XML (UI Design)
RecyclerView 
Adapters
Gradle

#Concepts
Used Java classes to model each contact (like name, number, etc.) and a data storage layer holds all the contacts.
A RecyclerView is used to display the contacts dynamically,Intents and Activities to move between screens like “Add Contact” and “View Contact”.
The UI updates automatically whenever a contact is changed.



Overall, this project helped me understand state management, data flow inside an app, and how UI and logic connect in Android.
